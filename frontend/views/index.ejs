                    responsible for defining the overall system structure, maintaining code style and quality, and
                    making final technical decisions. I handled the calibration of the reflective sensors, implemented
                    the maze start and finish logic. Integrated all individual code modules into a single unified
                    program. I also developed the website backend and frontend parts. It displays data received from the
                    robot and showing it in real time</p>

                    finished some business logic in following line and line maze, built the PostgreSQL in Render. I also
                    finished the backend part for robot website, which is Python version, and completed the middle part
                    of Arduino between the robot and website. </p>
